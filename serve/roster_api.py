roster_api.py — gated PII-roster backend (PROTOTYPE).

Serves named-voter rosters (first/last/address/city/precinct + last-voted
dates) filtered by jurisdiction and cohort. This is the *gated* counterpart to
the public aggregate dashboard: it reads PII straight from the enriched parquet
and is intended to run ONLY on localhost behind a token. Nothing it returns may
ever be written into docs/ or committed.

Design decisions (see CLAUDE.md + the prototyping discussion):

  * Reads ``local/source/parquet_enriched/enriched_voters.parquet`` — the same
    cache the weekly pipeline rebuilds. We never re-run cleaning here. The path
    is config-driven (``ROSTER_ENRICHED_CACHE``) so a hosted deploy can point at
    a different mount without a code change; the localhost default is unchanged.
  * Weekly-refresh aware: the loaded frame is cached in-process, but its source
    mtime is checked on every request. When the pipeline rewrites the parquet
    (atomic .replace), the next request transparently reloads it. No restart.
  * "Last voted primary/general" are DERIVED at load time from the 89 election
    columns (``PRIMARY-MM/DD/YYYY`` / ``GENERAL-MM/DD/YYYY``). Those columns are
    not chronologically ordered and are sparse (a value exists only if the voter
    cast that ballot), so we parse the date out of each column NAME and keep the
    max non-empty one per voter. Done once per load, not per query.
  * Auth: a single bearer token from ROSTER_TOKEN. Prototype-grade — replace
    with real session auth before this is exposed beyond localhost. The token
    is REQUIRED (startup fails loud otherwise) whenever ROSTER_HOST binds to a
    non-loopback address (e.g. a Tailnet IP) — see `_require_token_if_remote()`.
    Binding to 127.0.0.1/localhost/::1 keeps working with no token, for the
    zero-config local demo.
  * Stdlib http.server only — zero new deps. Swap for FastAPI/uvicorn when the
    gated web app is built for real.

Config (env vars; all optional, sensible localhost defaults):
    ROSTER_HOST            bind address (default 127.0.0.1)
    ROSTER_PORT            bind port (default 8000)
    ROSTER_TOKEN           bearer token; REQUIRED if ROSTER_HOST is non-loopback
    ROSTER_ENRICHED_CACHE  path to enriched_voters.parquet (default under local/)
    ROSTER_DB_PATH         path to captain.db (read by captain_db.py)

Run (local demo, no token needed):
    .venv/Scripts/python.exe serve/roster_api.py
    # then:  GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/roster?level=county&id=01&cohort=PURE_R

Run (non-loopback / Tailnet — token mandatory):
    ROSTER_HOST=100.x.y.z ROSTER_TOKEN=<strong-secret> .venv/Scripts/python.exe serve/roster_api.py
    # then:  GET http://100.x.y.z:8000/roster?level=county&id=01&cohort=PURE_R
    #        Authorization: Bearer <strong-secret>

Moving to a hosted service later is a config change only: point ROSTER_HOST at
the host's bind address, set ROSTER_TOKEN, and set ROSTER_ENRICHED_CACHE /
ROSTER_DB_PATH at the hosted paths — no code edit required.
