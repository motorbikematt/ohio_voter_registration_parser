"""Validate the jurisdiction-vs-postal city fields in an enriched voter parquet.

Run this whenever a new SWVF drop is ingested. It confirms the per-county field
coverage that the pipeline's municipality resolver
(`_dominant_city_per_precinct` in pipeline/voter_data_cleaner.py) depends on, and
flags any precinct that would be mislabeled by a postal-city fallback.

Background -- Ohio SWVF official file layout:
  https://www6.ohiosos.gov/ords/f?p=111:2  (also mirrored in
  local/source/Voter_File_Layout.md)
The voter file carries TWO unrelated location families:
    * Postal address:  RESIDENTIAL_CITY / RESIDENTIAL_ZIP ... -> USPS mail
      delivery only. NOT a legal jurisdiction.
    * Authoritative jurisdiction: CITY / VILLAGE / WARD / TOWNSHIP / PRECINCT ->
      the Board of Elections' assignment of where a voter legally votes. CITY is
      blank for voters in an unincorporated township (they vote in NO city);
      their TOWNSHIP column names the township.
Conflating them (backfilling a blank CITY from RESIDENTIAL_CITY) mislabels
township precincts with their post-office city -- e.g. Montgomery's
WASHINGTON TWP F (CITY='', TOWNSHIP='WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP') gets tagged KETTERING
because its mail is delivered from the Kettering post office.

The resolver therefore uses a jurisdiction HIERARCHY, not a postal fallback:
  CITY -> VILLAGE -> WARD-prefix -> TOWNSHIP(=not a city) -> RESIDENTIAL_CITY.
Bounded all-county checks established why: 69 counties populate CITY; 16 of the
remaining blank-CITY counties populate TOWNSHIP~100%; Cuyahoga (18) encodes the
municipality in its WARD prefix ('CLEVELAND WARD 7') and PRECINCT_NAME; only
Wyandot (88) has no authoritative column at all, so postal is a true last resort
there -- 1 county, not 19.

What this checks, per county:
  1. CITY coverage        -- % of voters with a non-blank authoritative CITY.
  2. Hierarchy coverage   -- for blank-CITY counties, the % populated of each
     fallback column (VILLAGE / WARD / TOWNSHIP) and whether ANY authoritative
     column covers the county. Counties with none are the true postal-last-resort
     set (expected: just Wyandot).
  3. Name conflicts       -- precincts whose NAME is a township/village but whose
     postal RESIDENTIAL_CITY is a different municipality (the mislabel risk a
     postal fallback would reintroduce).

Read-only (except --ledger). Bounded output. Exit code is non-zero under
--strict if any resolver-CONFIRMED postal mislabel exists (section [3b],
B1 2026-07-10) or a MUST-be-zero structural check fails, so this can gate
a pipeline run in CI.
