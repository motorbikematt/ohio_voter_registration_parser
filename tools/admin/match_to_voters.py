"""match_to_voters.py -- Stage 7: cross-reference every filer against the voter file.

The "consumer" stage of the officials/captains/candidates pipeline. It reads the
three frozen serve files produced by Session 1 --

  * serve/officials.json          -> entity_type "incumbent"
  * serve/precinct_captains.json  -> entity_type "captain_candidate"
  * serve/candidates.json         -> entity_type "general_candidate"

-- finds each person's own voter-registration record in the enriched parquet, and
attaches a `partisan_profile` (their lean score, primary history, and a plain-English
label). The combined result is written to serve/partisan_profiles.json.

SINGLE-RESOLVER RULE (CLAUDE.md section 5).  There is exactly ONE voter-matching
function, `match_entity`. The three entity types differ only in the *location
constraint* used to disambiguate same-name voters -- a zip code or a precinct name --
which is passed in as an optional parameter. We do NOT write a matcher per entity.

SWVF SCHEMA NOTES (CLAUDE.md section 4) honored here:
  * VOTER_STATUS is filtered to ACTIVE / CONFIRMATION only (the only two values).
  * COUNTY_NUMBER is a String -- filtered with == "57", never an int.
  * The lapse signal is PARTY_AFFILIATION == "" (SOS already applied the
    2-calendar-year window). We NEVER gate the profile label on a year threshold.
    Verified 2026-06-25: county-57 blanks are stored as "" (0 nulls); we still treat
    a null defensively as "" so the signal can never be silently skipped.
  * Home zip is HZIPCODE (electedofficials.csv) -- NEVER OZIPCODE (office address).
  * Postal fields are never used as a jurisdiction signal; zip is a name tiebreaker.

DATA NOTE -- temporary captain sources (2026-06). Captain data is a stopgap: DEM
and LIB come from one-off central-committee filing PDFs, and the Republican
committee report is absent (only the single CSV incumbent). The BoE's canonical
source for ALL elected officials -- including precinct captains -- is supposed to
be electedofficials.csv, which is not yet complete. This consumer is
source-agnostic: it reads whatever the frozen serve schema carries (see
serve/precinct_captains.json _meta.parties[*].coverage/source), so a future
complete electedofficials.csv does NOT change this file -- the data simply fills in.
