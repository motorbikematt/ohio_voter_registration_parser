axis_a_segments.py
==================

Single-snapshot ("Axis A") product segments for the subscriber tier.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
One named Polars expression per sellable segment, and nothing else. No CLI, no
I/O, no aggregation -- callers scan the enriched parquet themselves and apply
these predicates. This module is the single resolver for "who is a fresh
defector" and its four siblings: per CLAUDE.md section 5, a segment defined
inline at a call site is a divergent copy, and divergent copies are how the
postal-city bug survived weeks undetected.

Every segment traces to a numbered item in the Axis A subscriber-tier stack rank
(the ranking authority, held in the operator's working notes -- not in this
repo). Item numbers are cited per function so the mapping survives without it.
Nothing here DEPENDS on that document: every statutory claim below carries its
own R.C. / O.A.C. / EOM citation, and every data-quality claim names its ledger
entry in the repo-tracked DATA_QUALITY.md.

WHAT THESE FIELDS MAY NEVER CLAIM
---------------------------------
Every predicate here describes COUNTED BALLOTS, never engagement. This is a
statutory boundary, not a stylistic caution.

Ohio tracks a per-voter "Last Activity Type" with exactly seven codes -- VOT
(voting), ABR (absentee request), REG (registering), UPD (updating registration,
including updates with no changes), BMV (BMV interaction), PET (petition
signature), CON (confirmation-notice response) -- tie-broken in that order when
several fall on one day (O.A.C. 111:3-11-01(B)(1)-(9); R.C. 3503.15(C)(11); Ohio
Election Official Manual Ch. 4 section 4.04, pp. 4-96/4-98).

Only VOT is derivable from the SWVF election-history columns. Last Activity Type
itself is not in the statewide file -- it exists only in county files. A voter
with a completely empty ballot history can therefore be fully active in the
state's eyes because they renewed a licence at the BMV or signed a verified
petition.

Consequence for every function below: "has never cast a partisan primary ballot"
is a statement about ballots. It is never a statement about civic engagement,
persuadability-in-principle, or whether a voter is reachable. A segment that
claims otherwise is making a claim this data cannot support.

THE COUNTED-BALLOT RULE
-----------------------
A blank election cell means "no COUNTED ballot," not "did not attempt to vote."
Under the DATA Act (per EOM Ch. 4, "Voter History," pp. 4-149/4-150) voting
history is assigned only where the voter signed the pollbook, timely returned a
counted absentee (incl. UOCAVA/FWAB), voted early in person and the ballot was
counted, or cast a COUNTED provisional. A rejected ballot leaves a blank
indistinguishable from a non-vote.

Every count produced here is therefore a FLOOR on the true behaviour. The bias
has one direction only -- it shrinks the observed universe, never inflates it --
which is why the value claims survive it: a segment measured at N contains at
least N qualifying voters. Note also that a counted BLANK ballot does receive
history, so a GENERAL mark is not proof that any particular race was voted.

MEASURED FIGURES LIVE ELSEWHERE, DELIBERATELY
---------------------------------------------
Segment sizes, county shares, and reset rates are NOT recorded in these
docstrings. They belong to a snapshot, not to a definition, and this project has
already been bitten: the 8A prose quoted 152,060 for a cohort that read 155,254
after a regen landed mid-analysis. Current figures live in the stack-rank
deliverable and in DATA_QUALITY.md. The one exception is the Phase 1 gate anchor
in ``non_locked_crossers``, which is a reproducibility check, not a product
claim -- and it is stamped with the snapshot it was measured against.

FIELD PROVENANCE
----------------
All fields consumed here are produced by ``classify_all_voters_primary_history``
in ``pipeline/voter_data_cleaner.py`` -- the single resolver -- and survive a
pipeline rerun. None originates in a patch script.

    Voters with demonstrated cross-party primary behaviour who have not settled
    back into a single party. Stack-rank item 1 -- the top-ranked product.

    Definition: ``ever_crossed`` AND ``crossover_class`` in
    :data:`NON_LOCKED_CLASSES`.

    WHY THE CLASS FILTER IS PART OF THE DEFINITION
    ----------------------------------------------
    ``ever_crossed`` alone includes LOCKED_D and LOCKED_R -- voters who crossed
    historically but whose recent behaviour has re-consolidated. Selling those
    as persuadable is the error this segment exists to avoid.

    THE ARITHMETIC DOES NOT CLOSE, AND THAT IS CORRECT
    --------------------------------------------------
    ``crossers - locked != non_locked``. ``crossover_class`` is assigned only to
    cohorts CROSSOVER_R / CROSSOVER_D / UNC_MIXED (``voter_data_cleaner.py``
    ~line 2185); every other cohort gets NULL. A small residue of ``ever_crossed``
    voters therefore carries no class at all and is excluded here -- they are
    UNCLASSIFIABLE, not non-locked, and asserting either lean about them would be
    unfounded. Measured 2026-07-26 on the 2026-07-04 snapshot: 2,609 such rows
    statewide. The inverse (a class set while ``ever_crossed`` is False) was
    measured at exactly zero, so the two fields do not disagree in this snapshot.

    COUNTED-BALLOT RULE
    -------------------
    Crossing is understated: a voter whose only opposite-party ballot was
    rejected reads as never having crossed (module docstring). The bias shrinks
    this universe, so the item 1 value claim survives -- the real persuadable
    population is at least this large.

    2026-07-26. If the cache has been regenerated since, re-measure before
    treating this number as a gate: a gate that silently passes against a stale
    reference is worse than no gate.

# Item 2 -- recency tiering
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

def fresh_defector(years: float = FRESH_DEFECTOR_YEARS) -> pl.Expr:
    """
    Crossers whose MOST RECENT partisan ballot was itself the cross, within
    ``years``. Stack-rank item 2 (sequence shape / recency).

    Definition (STRICT reading, pinned): ``ever_crossed`` AND the final two
    characters of ``partisan_ballot_sequence`` differ AND
    ``years_since_last_partisan <= years``.

    ``partisan_ballot_sequence`` is oldest-first and compacted (non-votes removed),
    so a differing final pair means the voter's latest partisan act was a switch
    away from their prior ballot -- 'DDR' qualifies, 'DRR' does not.

    THE REJECTED ALTERNATIVE -- DO NOT SILENTLY REOPEN THIS
    -------------------------------------------------------
    A LOOSE reading was considered and rejected: ``ever_crossed`` AND
    ``years_since_last_partisan <= years``, i.e. "crossed at some point, and has
    voted a partisan primary recently." That is a different and much larger
    population -- it counts a voter who crossed in 2008 and has voted straight-D
    since as a fresh defector, which is precisely the LOCKED behaviour item 1
    already excludes.

    The two differ by ~4.6x on Montgomery at years=2.0 (17,485 loose vs 3,810
    strict, measured 2026-07-26). The strict reading is what the stack-rank
    actually measured for item 2, so it is what the Phase 2 reconciliation
    checks against. Changing this constant changes the product; changing the
    READING invalidates the Phase 2 gate and must be a documented decision, not
    an edit.

    COUNTED-BALLOT RULE
    -------------------
    Doubly understated: a rejected ballot can both hide a cross AND make the
    voter's apparent "most recent partisan ballot" older than it truly was.
    Direction is still one-way -- this is a floor.

    """
    Share of a geography's voters who have ever crossed. Stack-rank item 3
    (geographic clustering).

    NOT A VOTER-LEVEL PREDICATE. This is an aggregate expression intended for
    use inside ``.group_by(...).agg(...)`` over a geographic key -- county or
    precinct. Applying it row-wise is a category error: crossing is a property
    of a person, crossing RATE is a property of a place.

    Returns the mean of ``ever_crossed`` cast to float, i.e. the crossing share
    within the group.

    COUNTED-BALLOT RULE
    -------------------
    Aggregate rates inherit the counted-ballot undercount, but they inherit it
    UNIFORMLY only to the extent that ballot-rejection rates are uniform across
    geographies -- which is not established. Per CLAUDE.md section 5 (the
    88-county assumption), do not assume it: a county whose crossing rate is an
    outlier gets profiled before it gets sold as turf.

    OPEN FALSIFIER
    --------------
    The stack-rank left item 3's decisive test unrun: whether precinct-level
    variance in this rate exceeds binomial sampling noise. If it does not,
    crossing is a county-level phenomenon and precinct turf packets are not a
    sellable product form. Run before shipping anything precinct-scoped.

    Voters with a consistent one-party record who nonetheless vote primaries
    rarely, restricted to those with enough registration tenure for "rarely" to

    Definition: never crossed, has cast at least one partisan ballot, and was
    eligible for at least ``tenure_floor`` regular primaries.

    THE TENURE FILTER IS PART OF THE DEFINITION, NOT THE CALLER'S JOB
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    Without it this segment is a registration-tenure artifact: a voter who
    registered last year and has voted one primary has a low participation rate
    for a reason that has nothing to do with commitment. The stack-rank is
    explicit that only the filtered version is sellable. Exposing an unfiltered
    variant would recreate exactly the divergent-copy problem this module exists
    to prevent.

    REGISTRATION-DATE RESET -- THE FIGURE IS A FLOOR, NOT A CEILING
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    ``regular_primaries_eligible`` is anchored at
    ``min(REGISTRATION_DATE, first observed ballot)`` because Ohio preserves the
    original registration date through name and address changes but RESETS it on
    cancellation followed by reactivation (R.C. 3503.15(C)(9)(b)(ii); EOM Ch. 4
    p. 4-89). Ledgered as REGDATE-REACTIVATION-RESET in DATA_QUALITY.md.

    Resets SHORTEN apparent tenure. Voters whose true tenure clears
    ``tenure_floor`` but whose reset registration date does not are excluded
    here. The segment is therefore a floor -- it under-selects, never
    over-selects. Registration dates are additionally displaced around elections
    by the statutory blackout period (R.C. 3503.15(C)(9)(b)).

    NO MEAN OF ``primary_participation_rate``

    election-column set grows with every election.

    DO NOT PASS "THE LATEST GENERAL" -- PASS A NOVEMBER EVEN-YEAR GENERAL
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    The chronologically last GENERAL column is frequently an odd-year municipal
    general with a fraction of the turnout, and it silently produces a segment
    ~8x too small. Measured 2026-07-26: anchoring on GENERAL-11/04/2025 yields
    220,273 reachable statewide, while GENERAL-11/05/2024 yields 1,790,384.

    Blank cells arrive as empty strings, not nulls (CLAUDE.md section 4), so the

    WHAT "REACHABLE" MEANS AND DOES NOT MEAN

    It means: this voter has a counted general-election ballot on record despite
    no partisan primary signal. They belong in general-election persuasion and
    GOTV universes.

    It does NOT mean the voter engaged with any particular race. A counted BLANK
