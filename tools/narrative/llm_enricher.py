LLM-powered narrative enrichment for precinct captain briefs.

PURPOSE
───────
The deterministic template system (templates.py) produces statistically
accurate but clinical prose. This module takes those same structured
metrics and rewrites them into plain-English "neighbor briefings" — the
kind of thing a precinct captain can read on their phone before knocking
on a door and immediately understand who they're talking to.

Example of the difference:

  TEMPLATE:  "Anderson A Precinct has 614 registered voters, with 62.2%
              unaffiliated or lacking primary history. Republican-leaning
              voters make up 23.5% of registrants and Democratic-leaning
              voters account for 28.2%..."

  LLM:       "Just over 6 in 10 of your neighbors haven't picked a party
              primary — they're genuinely persuadable. Democrats have a
              small edge, but the real opportunity is that younger voters
              here lean noticeably bluer than longtime residents, which
              means turnout among newer arrivals is your best lever."

ARCHITECTURE
────────────
The module has two code paths:

  1. enrich_one(metrics) → str
       Synchronous single-jurisdiction call. Fast, simple. Good for
       on-demand enrichment of one precinct or county at a time (e.g.
       an API endpoint serving the dashboard).

  2. enrich_batch(metrics_list) → dict[slug, str]
       Asynchronous batch enrichment via the Anthropic Batch API.
       Submits up to 100,000 requests in one shot, polls until done,
       and returns a slug→narrative map. Used by the pipeline for
       bulk generation. Cost is 50% of real-time pricing.

Both paths accept the same dict shape produced by build_metrics_for_level()
and return the same plain-English string that the pipeline stores under the
"narrative_captain" key in each *_narrative.json file.

CACHING
───────
The cache key is the same metrics_hash already used by generate_narratives.py.
If an existing narrative JSON already has a "narrative_captain" field whose
"captain_metrics_hash" matches the current hash, we skip the API call. This
means the LLM is only invoked when the underlying data has actually changed
— not on every pipeline run.

GRACEFUL DEGRADATION
────────────────────
If the Anthropic API key is missing, the model call fails, or the module
is imported in an environment without the anthropic package, every function
silently returns None. The caller (generate_narratives.py) then falls back
to the templated narrative. This means the LLM path is purely additive
and never blocks a pipeline run.

MODEL CHOICE
────────────
We use claude-haiku-4-5 for single calls and batch submissions. Rationale:

  • Input to the model is tiny: ~200 tokens of structured metrics.
  • Output is short: 2-4 sentences (~80-120 tokens).
  • The task is straightforward prose rewriting, not reasoning.
  • Ohio has ~10,000+ precincts across 88 counties; Haiku's cost
    advantage (~5× cheaper than Opus) matters at that scale.
  • Haiku 4.5 supports streaming, prompt caching, and the Batch API.

The system prompt is cached via prompt_caching so repeated calls within
the cache TTL (5 minutes default) only pay ~0.1× for the system content.

PRIVACY / PII GUARANTEE
───────────────────────
The metrics dict passed to the LLM contains ONLY aggregate statistics —
percentages, voter counts, trend direction, and jurisdiction names. It is
derived from the same data that the template engine uses, which is already
fully anonymized before it reaches this layer. No individual voter data,
addresses, names, or SOS voter IDs are ever sent to the API.

USAGE (programmatic)
────────────────────
  from tools.narrative.llm_enricher import enrich_one, enrich_batch

  # Single jurisdiction (sync)
  captain_text = enrich_one(metrics)

  # Full county batch (async, returns when all done)
  import asyncio
  results = asyncio.run(enrich_batch(metrics_list))

USAGE (CLI — dry-run a single precinct)
───────────────────────────────────────
  python -m tools.narrative.llm_enricher --slug hamilton_precinct_addyston_a

ENVIRONMENT
───────────
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   Required for all LLM calls. If absent, functions
                       return None silently.

DEPENDENCIES
────────────
  anthropic >= 0.40.0   (pip install anthropic)
  The rest of the imports are stdlib or already used by the pipeline.

# ── Model and version constants ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# We freeze the model string here so a bump to a newer Haiku automatically
# invalidates any cached captain narratives (the model name flows into the
# cache key via ENRICHER_VERSION).
_MODEL = "claude-haiku-4-5"

# Bump this string whenever you change the system prompt, user prompt
# template, or model. That causes captain_metrics_hash values written by
# the old version to no longer match, triggering automatic re-generation
# on the next pipeline run (same pattern as TEMPLATE_VERSION in templates.py).
ENRICHER_VERSION = "v1"

# ── Prompt constants ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The system prompt is cached via the Anthropic prompt-caching feature
# (cache_control on the last system content block). Because the system prompt
# never changes across requests in a given process, the first call pays the
# cache-write premium (~1.25×) and all subsequent calls within the 5-minute
# TTL pay only ~0.1×. This is especially valuable during pipeline batch runs
# that submit thousands of single-call requests in a tight loop.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a data interpreter who briefs precinct captains — local political \
volunteers who knock on doors and make phone calls to their neighbors. You \
receive structured voter registration statistics for a specific jurisdiction \
(precinct, county, city, or district in Ohio) and write a plain-English \
neighborhood briefing.

RULES:
1. Write exactly 2-3 sentences. No bullet points. No headers.
2. Speak to the captain directly, as if you are handing them a note before \
they go out. Use "your neighbors," "your precinct," "your community."
3. Translate statistics into human terms: instead of "UNC – No Primary: 54%," \
say "more than half of your neighbors have never picked a party primary."
4. Highlight the single biggest opportunity for a Democratic organizer: \
persuadable unaffiliated voters, a generational shift, or an untapped base.
5. If the precinct leans Republican, be honest — but still identify the best \
opening (e.g., unaffiliated voters, young registrants trending blue).
6. Never use jargon: no "cohort," "net lean," "UNC," "lapsed," "Pure D/R." \
Use plain words: "neighbors who've never voted in a primary," "long-time \
Republicans," "younger voters."
7. Never invent facts not in the data. If a trend is absent, don't mention one.
8. Do not start with "In" or "The." Start with a vivid, direct observation."""

# The user prompt template is a Python f-string. We extract the most
# captain-relevant facts from the metrics dict and present them clearly.
# We deliberately omit raw percentages for sub-cohorts (Pure R, Mixed-Active,
# etc.) that would require explanation — the LLM gets the high-level picture
# it needs to write good briefings without data overload.

    The Batch API processes requests asynchronously at 50% of real-time
    pricing. For a full Ohio run (~10,000 precincts) this reduces LLM cost
    significantly compared to individual synchronous calls.

    Args:
        metrics_list: List of metrics dicts. Each must contain a "slug" key
                      (the jurisdiction's filesystem slug, e.g.
                      "hamilton_precinct_addyston_a"). This is used as the
                      batch custom_id so we can map results back.
        poll_interval_s: How often (seconds) to poll for batch completion.
                         Default 30s — the API docs suggest batches complete
                         within 1 hour but often much faster.
        max_wait_s: Maximum total seconds to wait before giving up. Default
                    3600 (1 hour). Callers that need a hard deadline can
                    lower this; the function returns whatever results are
                    available at timeout.

    Returns:
        Dict mapping slug → captain narrative text for every successfully
        processed request. Slugs that errored or timed out are absent from
        the dict; callers should fall back to the templated narrative.

    Raises:
        Nothing — all exceptions are caught and logged. Returns empty dict
        on total failure.

    Note on the "slug" key convention:
        The metrics dict produced by build_metrics_for_level() does NOT
        include a slug field — it's a pure data container. Callers of
        enrich_batch() must inject the slug before passing in, e.g.:
            metrics["slug"] = entry["slug"]
        The generate_narratives.py integration does this automatically.
