"""
Pass B — manifest.json jurisdictionScopes tests.

Validates the jurisdictionScopes registry in manifest.json (12 jurisdiction
types, county-scoping flags, dirName/index.json linkage against docs/data/).

History: this file originally also covered the V1 frontend (docs/index.html,
docs/charts.js) — a dropdown-select UI (jur-type-select / jur-county-select /
jur-name-select) driven by charts.js symbols like _setupJurisdictionControls.
That UI was replaced by the tree-nav hierarchy in docs/index.htm +
assets/v2.js; docs/index.html no longer exists and docs/charts.js is
unreferenced dead code. Those tests were removed rather than fixed. Two
charts.js tests (atomic .tmp write, classifier-mtime cache freshness) were
actually testing pipeline cache behavior via string-grep on source text —
duplicated, more rigorously, by test_pass_b_cache.py's monkeypatched
behavioral tests — so they were dropped rather than repointed.
