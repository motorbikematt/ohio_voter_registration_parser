# tools/tests/

Pytest suite plus two standalone report scripts, covering pipeline cache correctness, generated
`docs/data/` file/slug hygiene, and manifest/index schema consistency for the "Pass B" jurisdiction
build. Run with `pytest tools/tests/` from the project root (or target a single file).

### `conftest.py`
- **Function:** Pytest fixture-less bootstrap — inserts the project root onto `sys.path` so test
  modules can `import pipeline...` regardless of pytest's invocation directory.
- **Inputs / Outputs:** none; auto-loaded by pytest for every test in this directory.

### `test_pass_b_cache.py`
- **Function:** Unit tests (parametrized across both `pipeline.voter_data_cleaner` and
  `pipeline.jurisdictional_groupings`, which each carry their own copy of the same cache-freshness
  logic) for `_cache_is_fresh()` and `_write_cache_atomic()`. Covers: missing cache, no raw
  partitions, raw-partition newer than cache, **classifier source file newer than cache** (the
  critical case — a cohort-taxonomy code change must invalidate the cache even if the raw data
  didn't move), and atomic write leaving no `.tmp` file behind.
- **Inputs:** synthetic `tmp_path` fixtures (no real data); monkeypatches each module's
  `ENRICHED_CACHE`/`PARQUET_DIR`/`CLASSIFIER_SRC` module-level paths.
- **Outputs:** none (assertions only).
- **Requires:** `polars` (auto-skipped via `pytest.importorskip` if absent).

### `test_voter_data_cleaner.py`
- **Function:** Unit tests for the municipality-resolution helpers in
  `pipeline/voter_data_cleaner.py`: `_normalize_city_name` (strips CITY/VILLAGE/CORP suffixes),
  `_precinct_safe_name` (slugification), `_TOWNSHIP_NAME_RE` (detects township-token precinct
  names), and `_dominant_city_per_precinct` — the jurisdiction-hierarchy resolver itself. The
  hierarchy tests are regression tests for specific real-county bugs: CITY column always wins over
  postal `RESIDENTIAL_CITY`; a township-named precinct never resolves to a city even when postal
  data says otherwise; a township-name token outranks a minority village value; postal is only used
  as a true last resort when no authoritative column exists at all.
- **Inputs:** small inline `pl.DataFrame` fixtures built per-test.
- **Outputs:** none (assertions only).

### `test_data_slug_naming.py`
- **Function:** Filename/slug hygiene check over already-generated `docs/data/city/*.json` files.
  Catches two bug classes found in a 2026-07 incident: double underscores from un-stripped
  whitespace in a source name, and raw punctuation characters that the frontend's own
  `cityNameToSlug`/`countyToSlug` functions would never produce — either causes a silent 404 and a
  "No summary data found" page with no surfaced error. Deliberately scoped to `docs/data/city/`
  only (other jurisdiction types use a separate, pre-existing `name_(county)` convention that's
  out of scope here). One aggregating test rather than one-per-file, since the directory holds
  files across all 88 counties.
- **Inputs:** `docs/data/city/*.json` filenames only (reads no file contents — public, no-PII,
  no pipeline run required).
- **Outputs:** none (assertions only); test is a no-op (empty file list) if the directory doesn't exist.

### `test_pass_b_index.py`
- **Function:** Validates the per-jurisdiction-type `index.json` files written to
  `docs/data/{type}/` by the jurisdiction-index builder. Parametrized across all 12 known
  jurisdiction types. Checks: file exists and is a non-empty array; each entry (sampled, first
  10/20) has the required keys (`slug`, `name`, `display_name`, `county`, `county_slug`,
  `voter_count`, `charts`); `voter_count` is positive; `charts` includes `party_affiliation`;
  county-scoped types (township/village/municipal_court_district) carry non-null `county`/
  `county_slug` and a `display_name` ending in `(X Co.)`, non-scoped types carry null county
  fields; slugs have no duplicates and resolve to an actual `{slug}_party_affiliation.json` file.
- **Inputs:** `docs/data/{type}/index.json` for each of the 12 jurisdiction types.
- **Outputs:** none (assertions only).

### `test_pass_b_manifest_frontend.py`
- **Function:** Validates the `jurisdictionScopes` registry inside `docs/manifest.json` — all 12
  type keys present, each scope has the required fields (`key`, `display`, `displayPlural`,
  `dirName`, `countyScoped`), the `countyScoped` flag matches the actual county-scoped set, each
  scope's `dirName` exists under `docs/data/`, and each scope has a corresponding `index.json`.
  Docstring notes this file used to also test the retired V1 dropdown frontend
  (`docs/index.html`/`charts.js`, replaced by the tree-nav `index.htm`/`assets/v2.js`); those tests
  were deleted rather than repointed, and two cache-freshness tests were dropped as duplicates of
  `test_pass_b_cache.py`'s more rigorous monkeypatched versions.
- **Inputs:** `docs/manifest.json`, `docs/data/` directory structure.
- **Outputs:** none (assertions only).

## Standalone report scripts (not pytest)

### `test_jurisdiction_collisions.py`
- **Function:** Despite the `test_` filename, this is a standalone report generator, not a pytest
  test (no `assert`, has a `main()`). Detects jurisdiction name collisions — the same name (e.g. a
  TOWNSHIP or VILLAGE value) appearing under more than one `COUNTY_NUMBER` partition — which would
  silently merge into one output file if a grouping script slugged on name alone instead of a
  `(COUNTY_NUMBER, name)` composite key. Checks all 12 jurisdiction-type columns.
- **Inputs:** `local/source/parquet/**/*.parquet` (hive-partitioned by `COUNTY_NUMBER`).
- **Outputs:** `collision_report.md` at the project root (markdown table of colliding names +
  county lists per jurisdiction type); also prints an OK/COLLIDE summary per type to stdout.
- **Usage:** `.venv\Scripts\python.exe test_jurisdiction_collisions.py` (run from `tools/tests/`
  or adjust `BASE_DIR` expectations — it resolves paths from its own file location).
